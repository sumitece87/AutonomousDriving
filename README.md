New roads – difficult to adapt
Human – Machine gap 
Lack of collaboration with other cars
Lack of prediction tools 

1. License plate recognition – police application
2. Car lane detection 


Lack of collaboration + prediction 
Relative motion of a car
Number of lanes > 1
All have access to map

At t=0
v1 > v2
Is it safe to pass? 
How will you find out?

At t=1, to predict
v2 > v1
Is it safe to pass? 
How will you find out?
